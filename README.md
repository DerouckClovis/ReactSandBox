# ReactSandBox

Created with CodeSandbox

This is my React Quick Reminder.

In this code I have used :

- State
- Props
- Handlers
- Events
- Components
- Preventing reloads on submit
- Functional Components

And proper coding habits

## Description of this project

We have a simple page loading the **App Component**.
This **App component** is responsible of **displaying the result of the page**, which is a list of clients.
Inside this App Componenet, we will find **smaller components (or child components)** which will have their own role.

The **Client Component** will be responsible of **displaying each row** in the list.

The **ClientForm Component** will be responsible of **adding a new client** in the list.

In the end, **adding a client from the ClientForm Component** will **update the list displayed by the Client Component**, in the App Component.

We can **remove a client** by clicking the `X` at the right of a client's name.
